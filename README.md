## Reddit Terms

- **Subreddit**: A subreddit is a specialized community on Reddit dedicated to a specific topic, represented as /r/topic. For instance, /r/technology is a subreddit about technology. Each subreddit has its own rules, moderators, and community focus.

- **Post**: A post is content that a user submits to a subreddit. It can include text, links, images, videos, or questions for discussion. Other Redditors can upvote or downvote posts, impacting the post's visibility on the subreddit and across Reddit.

- **Comment**: Comments are responses that users leave under a post to discuss or provide feedback. Comments are crucial to Redditâ€™s interactive experience, as they enable discussions around the post.

- **Reply**: A reply is a response to a comment. Replies allow for threaded discussions, where users can respond to one another within a comment thread, creating a more organized conversation.

## Documents

- Reddit seem only have devvit doc for dev.

- [api documentation](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)

- Beyond devvit, redditdev seem to be the best resource for json data.

### Request for access [NO]

- You don't have to request access to the API. You just make an api token in the preferences page and start using it.

### PRAW: Python Reddit API Wrapper

    Also in current folder.

- The clients in this list only support cookie based login, or no login at all. Unauthenticated calls will require OAuth (See (Application only OAuth)[https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2#application-only-oauth]).
    These libraries will no longer be usable after August 3, 2015. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/2ujhkr/important_api_licensing_terms_clarified/) for more information.


### Json end-point

- **old.reddit.com** can be used for **JSON** instead of reddit.com

#### Does JSON end-point still work?

https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/17euhqe/why_do_the_json_endpoints_still_work/

Looking at the Ratelimit-Remaining/X-Ratelimit-Reset/X-Ratelimit-Used header data, the limit seems to be **96 calls in 600 seconds**, and it's per IP.

And if you're **authenticated** the limits seem to be **996 calls in 600 seconds**. 

#### Json schema

- Seem to share the same structure as API
    Is there an up-to-date documentation of the JSON schemas for Reddit's API responses ? 
    https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/bvd7w5/is_there_an_uptodate_documentation_of_the_json/
    Nope, [this is it](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/), and it doesn't include the response fields at all, much less an up to date version. 


### /api/ end-point
